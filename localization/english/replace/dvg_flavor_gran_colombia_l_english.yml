 dvg_gran_colombia.1.t:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.d:0 "For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms”."
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.f:0 "The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. We are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return. Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.a:0 ""Independence!" shouts the New World: The land of Columbus is bathed in heroes' blood!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.t:0 "The Colombian War for Independence"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.d:0 "As we feared, the appetite of the Spanish beast for blood and slaughter knows no limits. Spain has ended the armistice by formally announcing their intent to resume their efforts to destroy us. As our brave and noble soldiers march forth into battle, they do not go alone."
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.f:0 "They go with the spirits and the hearts of every man, woman, and child in the Colombian Alliance, with the love and the trust of every precious life which they are sworn to lay down their own to defend. Northern Arcadia and southern Ameriga have achieved freedom from their colonial masters – we can do no less."
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.a:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shall prevail!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.t:0 "Success in the Independence War"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.d:0 "Throughout its existence, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Alliance has been in a twilight zone of half-nationhood. A massive conglomeration of regions, cultures, and languages, many feared that the Alliance would disintegrate as soon as the war with Spain was won."
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.f:0 "It seems, however, that these fears were misplaced, or at least exaggerated. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has persevered as a unified entity, albeit as a highly decentralized confederation. The goal now is to untangle the government and find a stable, durable form of administration."
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.a:0 "At last, the true work begins."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.t:0 "The Independence War Meets with Failure"
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.d:0 "With the failure of the combined forces of Gran Colombia to beat the Spanish, the Colombian Alliance is dissolved and the Viceroyalty is reinstated."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.f:0 "Rumours abound of a new era of Spanish dominance over not only Ameriga, but Arcadia as well..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.a:0 "All we can do is tend our gardens beneath the Spanish flag."
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.t:0 "The Spanish Want a Truce"
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.d:0 "The Spanish decide to withdraw from Colombia..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.f:0 "With the war being waged for so long, the Spanish have decided to abandon the former Viceroyalty of New Spain. Gran Colombia shall now be free to decide its fate on the world stage."
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.a:0 "A victory nonetheless."
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.t:0 "Herrerian Revolution"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.d:0 "Guillermo de Blanco has finally emerged from hiding and led his guerillas into Bogota, capping off a period of raiding and recruitment that has seen his band of followers swell into a true revolutionary army. He has now declared the Republic of Herreria, named after the “Father of the Revolution,” José de Herrera, and is engaged in a fight for the fate of New Granada against the Spanish."
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.f:0 "As we share his animosity towards Spain, de Blanco has petitioned us to aid him, and to join forces against the Spanish Crown. If he is successful, then perhaps we could leverage this into Herreria joining the Colombian Alliance, finally securing the massive, revolutionary New World state of de Herrera’s dreams. Of course, more pessimistic, cynical ministers see de Blanco as a power-mad brute, infamous for his hatred of the Incas and more likely to be a liability than an ally. Still, surely a free Herreria is preferable to a hostile New Granada?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.a:0 "Herreria calls, and Colombia will answer!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.b:0 "Let de Blanco fight his own battles."
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.t:0 "Fall of Colombia"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.d:0 "”When this country was emancipated, it sought equality, justice, and reason. Yet the representatives that were elected did not represent the people, and the leaders that were chosen have not led us to success. The aim of this proclamation is to make clear the necessity of restoring honor to the nation…” – General Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.f:0 "The failure of the Colombian government to support the Herrerian Revolution and the collapse of the radical cause in New Granada has spurred dissent against the Vicente regime. A conservative general named Agustín de Santander took advantage of Vicente being confined to his bed with a fever, and led a military contingent into Mexico City, declaring himself the new President of Colombia. With the opposition paralyzed, it seems that Santander’s reign has already begun."
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.a:0 "Viva o Presidente!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.t:0 "The Colombian Navy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.d:0 "Grand Opening of the Colombian Navy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.f:0 "Wonderful news, my caudillo! We have recently finished with our project to build up a proper Colombian navy. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Cuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. With our newly created navy, hopefully we can reunite with our Cuban compatriots against Spanish imperialism once again."
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.a:0 "One step closer to Cuba!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.t:0 "Cuban Affair"
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.d:0 "The Conquest of Cuba"
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.f:0 "Great news! We have recently liberated Cuba from the Spanish once and for all. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Cuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. Since the Spanish are distracted by nationalist problems at home, we managed to liberate Cuba from their grasp, ending centuries of Spanish rule on the island."
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.a:0 "At last, the remnant of Spanish colonialism has returned to Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.t:0 "Granadan Affair"
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.d:0 "The Conquest of Granada"
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.f:0 "More news, my caudillo! After months of campaigning, we have recently conquered Granada. During the Colombian War of Independence, Granada was once a Spanish loyalist stronghold, but with the Spanish withdrawal, Granada remains no match to our might once we marched down to Medellín. Despite our liberation, we are currently facing resistance in Granada and we must quell it down before we could advance to our next target."
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.a:0 "Granada is ours!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.t:0 "The Pacification of Granada"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.d:0 "Pacifying Granada"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.f:0 "Despite the difficulties that we faced so far, we have recently pacified Granada for good. The Granadan resistance has cited nationalist reasons such as cultural and language differences between the Colombian and the Granadan, and that they wish to remain independent from Colombia. Luckily, our persuasion campaign to the Granadan populace has paid off with many Granadans agreed to join our cause for a greater Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.a:0 "Colombia grows larger everyday!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.t:0 "New Toledan Affair"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.d:0 "The Conquest of New Toledo"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.f:0 "Even more wonderful news! We have recently finished our liberation of New Toledo. Despite the New Toledans' contribution to our liberation of Granada from Spanish rule, they have remained hesitant with joining Colombia. Since our liberation, we have began sending officials to convince the New Toledans on supporting to unification of Colombia and New Toledo."
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.a:0 "At last, the total reunification from Colombia to New Toledo!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.d:0 "Military Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.f:0 "Since Spain no longer controls continental Ameriga and Arcardia, let us focus on our military relation with Granada and New Toledo. One option is a full military alliance between the three nations. Another option is to form a defensive pact between the three nations. The last option would be to keep relation at arm's length to avoid any complications when either Granada or New Toledo is at war."
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.a:0 "Let us cement the Colombian alliance!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.b:0 "Let us keep it as a defensive pact."
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.c:0 "It is best to keep the relation at arm's length."
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.d:0 "Trade Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.f:0 "Since we are done with the military policy, let us focus on trade policy. Considering that all three nations are underdeveloped currently, one proposal would be to establish a custom union so all three nations can have access to each other's market. Another option is to establish trade agreements between the three nations to allow reduced tariffs for trade goods while ensuring that the three nations' markets remain independent. The third option is to do neither as the Colombian market would not benefit from either deals."
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.a:0 "A trade agreement would suffice."
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.b:0 "On second thought, maybe this is not necessary."
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.t:0 "The Fate of Vicente"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.d:0 "President Anastasio Vicente has been under an unusual amount of stress lately. Rural landowners and provincial caudillos are beginning to express opposition to any reform of the current, massively decentralized system, alarmed by Vicente’s federalist proposals. The president has received some rather irate and threatening letters over his plans, but these crude attempts at intimidation have not dissuaded him. He knows that federalism is necessary for Colombia to be more than just a republican New Spain."
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.f:0 "Colombia will never develop a national identity unless it is one nation, and it will never be one nation if it leans too far either towards ruthless centralization or slothful decentralization. As Vicente continues his work, this time on a letter to the Caudillo of Andagoya about tariffs, he hears a noise at the door. Strange, he thinks to himself - everyone else in the presidential palace ought to be asleep by now. Heading to the door, he opens it to find…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.a:0 "His faithful black cat, Santa Anna"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.b:0 "An assassin, who guns him down and flees out the window!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.t:0 "The Death of Vicente"
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.d:0 "Rumors of the President’s assassination spread through Mexico City like a wildfire, but only this morning was it confirmed, in a somber announcement by Vice President Benito Villa. The murder of the Father of the Nation has caused Mexico City to descend into chaos. As Vicente had not yet formalized the method of presidential succession, the uncharismatic Villa has been all but forgotten as multiple politicians and officers have declared themselves acting president of Colombia. Street brawls have erupted into shootouts, as neighborhoods become battlegrounds."
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.f:0 "Two sides have emerged: the centralists, who see Vicente’s death as proof that a strong hand is needed to rule Colombia, and the radical federalists, who are prepared to take decentralization to its limits if it means preventing more violence in the future. As the blood flows through the streets of the cradle of south Arcadian liberty, it is unclear whether this is Colombia’s crucible or its requiem."
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.a:0 "God help us all!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.t:0 "The Plan of Toluca"
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.d:0 "Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lusitanian General Deodoro Peixoto managed to secure control of the Mexico City countryside. Backed by the rural landowners, Peixoto and his supporters gathered in Toluca and proclaimed the Plan of Toluca. In it, Peixoto has declared the Colombian experiment to be a failure! Citing the “irreconcilable” differences between its various regions and cultures, Peixoto seeks to allow Colombia’s constituent parts to go their own way."
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.f:0 "With overwhelming support from various caudillos, he fought his way back into the capital and quelled the unrest, being sworn in as President shortly thereafter. Soon, the Colombian legislature shall hold a vote to abolish the Alliance, and then Colombia’s major provincial caudillos will meet in Oaxaca City in two weeks to officially dissolve it."
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.a:0 "Perhaps we were not meant to be one nation."
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.t:0 "The Oaxaca Protocol"
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.d:0 "Tensions in Colombia exploded in the aftermath of President Vicente’s assassination. No figure has yet emerged who could unify the confederation with the charisma and diplomacy of Vicente, or who commands as much respect as he did. Bowing to what radical federalists see as the inevitable, the Colombian legislature passed a bill voting the nation out of existence, and now the caudillos of Colombia’s various provinces have convened in Oaxaca City to dissolve the confederation."
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.f:0 "President Peixoto opened the event with a short but poignant speech reiterating the need for dissolution, arguing that Colombia as a single nation-state will inevitably become repressive and that each nationality must obtain liberty. However, there are whispers that Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro, popular centralist icon, escaped the Mexico City anarchy and has been preparing to stage a coup in a desperate bid to avert the confederation’s dissolution. What shall be the fate of Colombia?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.a:0 "Peixoto secures Colombia’s end – and Lusitania for himself."
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.b:0 "Castro invades the city, arrests the radicals, and seizes Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.t:0 "The Plan of Veracruz"
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.d:0 "Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lieutenant Colonel Castro took control of the vital port city of Veracruz while order in the rest of the country began to collapse. A dashing young Cuban, he proved a skilled tactician during the First Colombian War of Independence, repeatedly outfoxing the Spanish with clever and innovative maneuvers, and rose meteorically through the ranks. He achieved true fame when he liberated Veracruz and then fended off three separate Spanish attempts to reconquer it."
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.f:0 "Now, in the city which won him his fame, Castro has rallied the military and the centralists to his side with the Plan of Veracruz, announcing his intention to establish a strong central government and curtail radicalism. Even some rural elites have supported him, possibly believing that he will prove a pawn if successful. With most of the military now loyal to him, he has fallen like a thunderbolt upon Mexico City, and soon enough he shall be sworn in as the new President."
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.a:0 "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.t:0 "Castro’s Inaugural Speech"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.d:0 "After Castro was sworn into office, he gave a speech to the assembled crowd, outlining his goals and intentions going forward. “Colombia is destined to be a colossus of the New World,” he declared, “but only if we give her the sword and the shield which she needs.” Castro went on to explain that this meant a strong, centralized government, an orderly political sphere, and a bold foreign policy “unafraid to make adventurous choices in the interest of liberation.” He confidently predicted that Colombia will be “the true seat of power in the New World.”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.f:0 "Castro wound up his remarks by stating that he was “prepared to bring a new, visionary strength to the Colombian executive, the likes of which few have seen before, or even dreamt of.” Centralists and expansionists were thrilled by his rhetoric, but many others - especially rural elites - were concerned by his implications. #red If Castro does not make Colombia a world power, then there may be consequences.#"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.a:0 "May he steward Colombia well!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.t:0 "Castro's Ambition"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.d:0 "The Cuban Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.f:0 "As Castro continues to reshape domestic politics, he has taken an interest in foreign affairs as well. Specifically, he has set his sights upon Cuba, and has initiated a media campaign to promote the Colombian government’s claim to the island. Castro has stressed Cuba’s “ethnic and political kinship” with Colombia, its “indisputable destiny” to “be united” with Colombia, and the “urgent necessity” of “admitting” Cuba into “our grand nation.” The Cuban authorities have taken this news poorly, and Castro’s bellicose remarks have been criticized both by Cuban conservatives, who are largely sympathetic to the Spanish crown and fearful of Colombian radicalism, and Cuban liberals, many of whom demand a free and sovereign Cuba. Nevertheless, Castro has committed vast political resources to acquiring Cuba. #red If Castro cannot fulfill his assertions, then there may be consequences.#"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.a:0 "Cuba was, is, and will be Colombian!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.t:0 "The Second Coup"
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.d:0 "The Plan of Colima"
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.f:0 "”I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood, which is about to be shed, be for the good of the country. Long live Colombia, long live independence!” – Last words of Ernesto Castro\n\nIn the chaos following Vicente’s death, Colombians saw Ernesto Castro as the man who could raise Colombia to greatness, but Castro has failed to fulfill his lofty promises. The caudillos have been disillusioned by his callous centralization, and they have sought another savior. They found General Agustín de Santander, an ambitious and charismatic officer of noble blood and with many elite connections. Santander issued the Plan of Colima, promising to end centralization and respect Colombia’s regional differences, and rallied public support against Castro. Quickly marching on Mexico City, Castro was deposed after a brief battle, before being tried, convicted, and executed for treason. Once more, the presidency of Colombia has been claimed through bloodshed."
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.a:0 "Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.t:0 "Santander's Rise"
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.d:0 "The Plan of Colima"
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.f:0 "Castro’s overthrow by a liberal revolution was supposed to usher in a new era of enlightened, scientific governance. Yet this concept terrified caudillos across the nation, who stood to lose much from the liberal disdain for traditional networks of power. To preserve their influence, they have rallied behind General Agustín de Santander, a man of noble blood and charismatic personality. Santander recently issued the “Plan of Colima,” denouncing the liberals as heartless thieves, promising to respect Colombia’s regional differences, and exhorting the Colombian people to stand up for their traditions and institutions. Flush with caudillo money, Santander then swooped down on Mexico City with an army of followers, casting out the liberals and claiming the Colombian presidency for himself. With Castro’s wife taking his infant son into exile in the Dual Monarchy, both liberalism and Castroism lie defeated, and the age of Santander has begun."
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.a:0 "Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!"

 dvg_gran_colombia.24.d:0 "The Self Coup and Aftermath"

As the Emperor was heading through downtown Mexico City on his return from a diplomatic visit to the Dual Monarchy, an assassin leapt from the crowd and fired upon him! Both he and his wife, Empress Eva, were pronounced dead at the hospital. The assassin, quickly apprehended by the gendarmes, was identified as Emilio Cardenas, an anarchist with ties to republican groups. The regicide has horrified Colombians yet has not ignited revolts. While many republicans are now trying to press for radical political change, it seems that the rule of the House de Castro has been accepted, the popularity of the new Emperor Ernesto II – and the regency which shall rule until he is no longer a child - sealed by the martyrdom of his father."

As Santander reviews his options to deal with the situation, he realizes that a simple military campaign will not be enough. No, as long as these troublesome identities persist within Santander’s realm, they will continue to be thorns in his side – the Indians and the Lusitanians are two sides of the same problem.

While Lusitania and San Salvador show no signs of wishing to return to our fold, the native states must be dealt with.

He denounced Santander as a mad, murderous despot, and promised the restoration of democracy and an end to costly foreign adventures in favor of internal rebuilding. With most of the military supporting them, Diaz and his men seized Mexico City with little trouble. Santander was found dead in his bedroom, having taken a knife to himself like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. With his regime of surveillance and oppression dismantled, many liberals have begun to return from exile, eager to build a more peaceful Mexico.

Witnesses testified about his cruelty, bigotry, and history of paranoid delusions. Towards the end of the trial, he grew prone to sudden outbursts, at one point wailing, “O World, why do you persecute me?” Condemned to death, he was taken to the Mexico City barracks and executed by firing squad.

Santander’s hyper-centralism has been discarded in favor of a federal republic, with rights and responsibilities split between state and federal governments without either dominating the other.

 dvg_colombian_settling_the_cordillera_arcadiana_desc:0 "The Californian War granted us the regions of Gran Teguayo and Bermejo, colloquially known as the Cordillera Minquillana territories, named after the mountains of western Arcadia. These regions remain quite rural, with few cities outside of the military forts and the old Qingqiuese settlements. While the pacification of various Native tribes and the Xijiao fanatics was arduous, those times are over, and this calm has allowed geologists and botanists to conduct surveys there. If reports are true, then they hold fabulous mineral wealth, as well as excellent farming areas. The new “conservationist” movement is already agitating for several especially beautiful parcels of land to be set aside as national parks, which could enhance our international prestige. Best of all, this frontier is a virgin land, free of the colonial identities of Mexico, Lusitania, California, or Salvador. Let us develop this land, with a railroad linking the coast to Copala, so it becomes the crucible of a new Colombian identity!"

Old Spanish reals (silver coins), once prized the world over for their consistent weight but loathed by accountants for their irregular shape and appearance, still dominate our domestic market. We must bring order to this chaos! Minister of Finance Martim Barbosa has devised a new currency, the Colombian peso, backed by gold and silver deposits in the national treasury. Going forward, all domestic commerce will be required to be conducted with pesos, and all other forms of currency will be phased out. With this, we will stabilize our internal market and end the currency madness."

Moreover, state banks in nations like Burgundy and Scandinavia have been crucial in backing government projects. Let us create the National Bank of Colombia to act as the primary lender to our government. The law creating this bank will also empower our government to control the banking sector at large, including chartering banks, setting minimum levels of capital, and stipulating that all paper money must be backed by gold or silver in the national treasury. This endow our government with the power to intervene in otherwise catastrophic economic swings, and keep the markets stable.

However he has grown more conservative, and after the death of Vicente, he allied with Castro to help him solidify power. Mirabal not only kept his post but was granted more power than ever before. Today, his project of a national police (dubbed the Hidalgueria Nacional (National Mounted/Noble Police) by Castro) was approved, giving him the tools to cement unitary rule over the Republic. The protests which have broken out in Lusitania and Salvador shall soon be quelled by the military and the Hidalgueros"

 dvg_marquess_oaxaca:0 "Employ the 12th Marquess of Oaxaca"
 dvg_marquess_oaxaca_desc:0 "Castro often said that “Diplomacy is only police in a rich costume”, yet, he understood how isolated Colombia was when he took power. After decades of war with Spain, Colombia’s only foreign presence was its permanent consulates in Anvers, Copenhagen, and Rome. Thus he turned to Henrique de Albuquerque-Cortès, son of famed Vicente ally Dom Gaspar de Albuquerque-Cortès.\n\nDom Gaspar was a liberal monarchist who hoped to offer the Colombian crown to the Spanish king after the fall of Lisbon. His son Henrique was left stranded in the metropole after Gaspar escaped to Mexico. Thus the younger Albuquerque-Cortès obtained a minor diplomatic post from King Pedro IV, who sought to play father and son against each other. The young man proved to be a vital asset in reducing Spanish dependency on Paris, working with Burgundy to prevent an Anglois annexation of Atlantia. While Albuquerque-Cortès kept his titles after Pedro IV’s fall, the new king clashed with the Marquess and did not renew his employment.\n\nThe Marquess accepted Castro’s offer on the condition of being reinstated in his properties, leading to several demonstrations and petitions from the Zapotecs of Oaxaca. Despite this, he would lay the foundations of a modern and efficient Colombian Foreign Office, equal to that of the Great Powers."

Independence did not change this fact : the territory of the Fatherland was one, but the nations diverse. Now Colombia breathes, and the Constitution given to her by her Consul, allows her to think of her prosperity. Our task has been to establish a new set of laws to guarantee property and morality, for only private virtues guarantee public virtue.” - Juan Manuel de Guzman’s announcement of the Civil Code\n\nNew civil law codes abounded during the era of Revolutions, such as the German project in 1793 which in turn inspired the Etrurian Civil Code of 1826. With most of Colombia’s laws inherited from the colonial era, Castro tasked jurists led by Minister of Justice Juan Manuel de Guzman to create a unified Civil Code for Colombians. The hope was to unify not only the courts but the nation. While heavily inspired by the Etrurian Code, it was notable for its emphasis on family values and properties while also expanding certain colonial laws across Colombia."
 dvg_concordat_with_rome:0 "Negotiate a Concordat with the Church"
 dvg_concordat_with_rome_desc:0 "Colombia may have been founded by Catholics with a history of connection to Rome, but our constitution still guarantees a wide freedom of faith. This has strained the Empire of Colombia’s relations with the Papacy, given our attempt to claim divine right to rule while also permitting other faiths to coexist. To improve his legitimacy in the eyes of the church and avoid escalation with Rome, His Majesty can send a delegation to the Holy See to negotiate. What Ernesto proposes is a compromise between liberal ideas and traditional Christian values. Catholicism will be reaffirmed as the official faith of the Colombian Empire, and the government will grant payment to Catholic priests, but other religions will still be protected by the Crown. The Papacy will surely not dare protest such a benevolent arrangement."
 dvg_imperial_universities:0 "Develop the Imperial Universities"
 dvg_imperial_universities_desc:0 "The Royal and Pontifical Universities of Mexico, Mérida, and Guadalajara were casualties of the Independence Wars. As they were run by the Church, most instructors were Spanish loyalists who incurred the wrath of Colombian liberals. Upon independence, they disintegrated into smaller institutions with little renown, while Colombia’s elites either hired tutors for their children or sent them to Europe to study. But if these facilities were to be reformed then they could be the foundation of a modern Colombian university system. Let us restore the old universities as public institutions under state rather than church control, with refurbished campuses and state-of-the-art resources. This will keep Colombian students within Colombia, and cultivate a new intellectual class within our society."
 dvg_liceos:0 "Create the Liceos"
 dvg_liceos_desc:0 "”We destroyed everything and it is time we create anew. There is a government with established powers, but what is the rest of the nation but grains of sand? We are masters of our fate but we will not keep it if we do not lay masses of granite upon the soil of Colombia. As Christ built his Church upon the rock of Peter, so we build the future of Colombia upon the liceos.” - Ernesto Castro\n\nEducation in New Spain was reserved to elites and had deteriorated even before the Independence Wars. Many of Vicente’s followers sought to secularize education and create a national system of free public schooling, but Castro was more pragmatic. He created high schools in each provincial capital - dubbed “liceos” after the Greek Lyceum of Antiquity - where young boys would learn military discipline alongside sciences and humanities. While most students came from the local elites, Castro also provided a system of scholarships for the most deserving pupils of the lower classes in the Revolutionary spirit of equality. By the end of the 19th century, all Colombian administrative and military elites would be selected from the liceos’ students, a key step towards a modern schooling system."
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano:0 "Fund the Imperial Colombian Railways"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_desc:0 "The Colombian government, Castro most of all, has always envied the railways of Europe. Messages take months to travel across the nation, delayed by the agonizing geography of Mexico which almost feels like an active foe of a fast and efficient bureaucracy. Previously, the thought of a Colombian railway network seemed a fantasy, due to the enormous mountains of the Sierra Madre, their very presence a mockery of the idea emanating out like the dark clouds of their volcanoes. Now a group of Mexico City engineers have drafted a plan for a grand new railway using new European techniques and technology. It will start in Veracruz, pass through Mexico while squeezing through the mountains, and terminate in Tepic and San Blas, on the Pacific Coast. Sponsoring this “Ferrocarril Imperial Colombiano” might finally end the communication difficulties that have plagued our administration for decades."
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_san_salvador:0 "Fund the Mexico-San Salvador Railway"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_san_salvador_desc:0 "With the Ferrocarril Imperial having proven its worth, it is time for its greatest expansion yet. The dense jungles and formidable terrain of San Salvador brought many conquistadors and colonial bureaucrats to grief. Even today, the land is an archipelago of towns within a sea of dense wildlife that makes development a Herculean struggle. Yet small railways have already been built to transport goods from the interior to the coasts for export. If their gauges can be expanded, they could serve as the foundation for an interior rail network, and connected together by new routes built further inland. It is doubtful that this will be the end of our infrastructure problems in San Salvador, but something must be done. Let our indomitable workers face their greatest trial yet, and lay the final jewel in Colombia’s iron crown!"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_california:0 "Fund the Mexico-California Railway"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_california_desc:0 "The unforgiving peaks of the Sierra Madre Occidental which run along the western Lusitanian coast have been an insurmountable barrier between California and Mexico since the colonial era. Even today, most north-south travel goes by sea rather than land. Developments in infrastructure technology, however, may at last present a solution to this problem. Imperial engineers have submitted plans for a new line to extend the western Lusitanian railways north into California and south into western Mexico. The plans also include a new branch of lines in California proper. This may be the start of a transport revolution in California, with the Ferrocarril Imperial Colombiano acting as the ties by which the north shall be eternally unified with the rest of the nation."
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_lusitania:0 "Fund the Mexico-Lusitania Railway"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_lusitania_desc:0 "Compared to the harsh terrain and dizzying peaks of Mexico, Lusitania - at least in part - is an easier land to tame. Its geography still boasts rugged cliffs and mountains, but not on the same scale. The plains of the east, having been pacified, are well-suited to rail construction. This project may at long last solve the divide between eastern Lusitania and Mexico that has endured since the colonial era, which has long hindered regional unity and with it regional development. The Ferrocarril Imperial Colombiano will do what the Spanish Crown could not and make Lusitania indisputably modern and indisputably Colombian!"

When one walks past the Victory Column, the Chapultepec fountain, or Independence Avenue, his success is difficult to dispute.” - Bartolomeo Las Cases, official biographer of Ernesto Castro\n\nCastro did not come from Mexico, but he recognized its importance and sought to remake it. Working with many architects, he devised plans for a new water supply system while draining and filling what was left of the old lakes to improve hygiene. New monuments to his glory, chief among them the Elephant fountain of Chapultepec built with the bronze cannons stolen to the Qingqiuese and Spanish, wide avenues, and a monumental train station, all required a tremendous work force that was soon found among the political and common convicts sent to penal colonies. Despite continuous funding and effort, the Emperor would die before seeing most of his projects finished."
 dvg_confiscation_castro:0 "The Law on Indian Corporations"
 dvg_confiscation_castro_desc:0 "In the days of New Spain, lands were allotted to Indian communities across the colony as corporations held in common by the people. Such agreements were also extended to the Catholic Church to cover their own holdings. After the Independence Wars, the religious corporations became the center of debate but the Indian corporations laid in the background. Now reformers are pushing for the government to abolish the Indian corporations. They argue that transferring the lands to private hands will expand the real estate market and the middle class in rural Colombia while also providing the government with badly needed capital. #red A few radicals in government warn that confiscating the last preserves of the natives could ignite a rebellion, but that is a risk we must take.#"
 dvg_ciudad_victoria:0 "Veracruz, La Ciudad Victoria"
 dvg_ciudad_victoria_desc:0 "Veracruz is the most important port city in Hispanic Arcadia. It was here that the fall of the Aztec Empire began : it was here that nearly all of New Spain’s eastward trade was conducted : and it was here where Ernesto Castro gained immortal fame for his military brilliance. Today, Veracruz has also become the main arsenal of the Colombian Navy, and retains its economic importance. But time has been unkind to the city and its current state does not befit its reputation. Let us change this! Several proposals have been received for the redesign of Veracruz, “The City of Victory,” along beautiful European lines like Anvers. Wide boulevards, public parks, new canals, and updated port facilities will restore Veracruz’s status as the jewel of Arcadia. The centerpiece will be a towering statue of the Hero of Veracruz himself in the city square, forged from bronze by the finest Burgundian sculptors."
 dvg_puertoriental:0 "Establish Puertoriental, Home of the Pacific Fleet"
 dvg_puertoriental_desc:0 "San Bias is a small port on the coast of Tepic. It was a notable colonial-era port with economic ties throughout the Pacific Ocean, but it sank from relevance during the Independence Wars. Many Mexicans are envious of the prosperous city of Porto Novo to the north, which dominates Pacific trade ever since the decline of Acapulco. Now a group of imperial engineers have reported that San Bias would be an excellent site for a new western Colombian port. The Pacific Fleet needs a new base, after all, and Porto Novo’s facilities are dominated by civilian trade. The remodeling of San Bias is also an opportunity to introduce European-style planning and create a model for Colombian civic beauty - and, of course, reduce Porto Novo’s preeminence. Let us coronate this new western gem Puertoriental!"
 dvg_escuela_normal:0 "Develop the Normal Schools"
 dvg_escuela_normal_desc:0 "Colombian education reformers have become fascinated by Burgundy’s “écoles normales”, model schools where student-teachers can learn the arts of pedagogy and curriculum. If this system could be imported into Colombia, then it could establish a state-run educational system entirely separate from the old ways of Church-run schools. A rapid expansion of the teacher base is especially needed in rural areas which have been neglected by urban elites for centuries. By opening such institutions across Colombia, we can train the next generation of educators across a broad section of society and bring teaching outside of urban centers."
 dvg_la_reforma:0 "Pass the Land Reforms"
 dvg_la_reforma_desc:0 "In the days of New Spain, lands were allotted to the Catholic Church and Indian communities across the colony as corporations. But many in both New Spain and later Colombia saw such arrangements as folly for taking the lands outside of the market and locking them out of the turn of modernity, not to mention the power they gave the Church. Now reformers are pushing for the government to confiscate these lands. They argue that transferring the lands to private hands will expand the real estate market and the middle class in rural Colombia while also providing the government with badly needed capital. Most of all, it will drive a stake into the heart of the Church’s power in Colombia, as seen by similar efforts in Spain. #red A few radicals in government warn that the Indians and the peasants may resort to violence to protect their lands, but reformers insist that the benefits outweigh the risks.#"
 dvg_nova_lisboa_renovation:0 "Renovate Nova Lisboa, A Estrela do Nordeste"
 dvg_nova_lisboa_renovation_desc:0 "Nova Lisboa, the cultural heartland of the Lusitanians of Entre-Tierras, was never destined to exist. When its founders settled near the mouth of the Santo António river, the city quickly developed from a quaint latifundia like dozens of others dotting Lusitania, to one of the busiest settlements of northern Colombia. However, its thin cobbled streets, lack of urban planning, and winding farmer’s estates dotting its outskirts hamper its potential towards becoming Tejas’ foremost city. A large-scale renovation plan has been drafted to bring Nova Lisboa to modernity, with grand avenues leading towards the city’s center, the Palácio dos Governadores, widespread relocation of sporadically built hamlets, and infrastructure expansion with an eye towards future construction. May the Star of the Northeast be reborn just as Colombia has been!"
 dvg_porto_novo_renovation:0 "Redesign Porto Novo, the Pacific Gate"
 dvg_porto_novo_renovation_desc:0 "Eastern Colombia has Veracruz - Western Colombia has Porto Novo. After the Great Migration of Californian settlers during the conflicts with Japan and later Qingqiu, the city quickly grew to rival Acapulco, Colombia’s previous foremost western port. Compared to the southern city, its terrain was far less treacherous. Many merchants who were unsuccessful in Acapulco moved north to Porto Novo, and the city also benefited from becoming the new gateway to northwestern Arcadia. But these waves of migration were haphazard and the city’s erratic growth reflected this. It was the invention of the steamer that made Porto Novo the prime hub of Asian-Colombian exchange, with ships now unbound from trade winds. With new status comes a need for a new design! Grand streets, an expanded harbor, and most of all, the development of the bayside area into a splendid new home for people and businesses, shall make Porto Novo the envy of the Pacific."

With most of Colombia’s laws inherited from the colonial era, there has always been a strong desire to overhaul the legal system and bring it into modernity. Let us consult the legal codes of Europe and draft new statues to unify not only the courts but the nation.

It was there that the fall of the Aztec Empire began : it was there that most of New Spain’s eastward trade was conducted : and it was there that Vicente and his vanguard landed in 1827 to initiate the greatest chapter in our heroic struggle for independence. This is the city where Colombia began and it is where the heart of Colombia should lie, through with a new name to honor the father of the country, Ciudad Vicente. Mexico City has served its purpose in nurturing the cause for independence, however the city’s continued use as our capital has made the Mexicans feel as though they are the first among equals in the alliance.

However, its position as the beating cultural heart of Gran Colombia and Entre-Tierras shall not be disputed in our time, and such a revalorization process, architectural first and foremost, will seek to lay bare the city’s ancient past, a true jewel in a Mesoarcadian-Hispanic cultural continuum, hundreds of years in constant change."

While disparate villages exist on the different corners of the Bay, belonging to different jurisdictions, the region never prospered and remained relatively isolated from the rest of San Salvador. However, with Pacific trade booming and a few years past the last Cosigüina’s eruption in 1859, large-scale plans are being drawn up. They envision San Lorenzo de Fonseca, located in a fertile estuary and near the geographic center of the Gulf, being transformed into a modern port and bustling city. To this end, we will incentivize migration into San Lorenzo with land grants and leases, the construction of a truly modern port and the foundations of what will no doubt become another jewel in our western crown!"
